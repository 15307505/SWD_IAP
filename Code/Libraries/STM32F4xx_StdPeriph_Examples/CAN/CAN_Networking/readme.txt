@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive 
CAN frames in normal mode. The sent frames are used to control LEDs by pressing  
KEY push-button.
	
The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - After reset LED1 is ON
  - By Pressing on KEY Button : LED2 turns ON and all other LEDs are OFF, on the N
    eval boards connected to the bus. 
  - Press on KEY Button again to send CAN Frame to command LEDn+1 ON, all other LEDs 
    are OFF on the N eval boards.
    
 @note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is 
       loaded in all units to send and receive frames.

 @note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing KEY button)
       or receiver.

The CAN is configured as follows:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s  
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
		- ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
		- RTR = Data
		- DLC = 1 byte
		- Data: LED number that should be turned ON

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use KEY Push Button connected to PG15 
    - Connect a female/female CAN cable between at least 2 EVAL CAN connectors (CN10)
    - You have to configure the jumpers as follows:

  @verbatim    
       +-------------------------------+
       |   Jumper    |       CAN1      |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   JP3       |       2-3       |
       |   JP10      |       2-3       |
       |   JP7       |       1-2       |
       |   JP9       |      fitted     |
       +-------------------------------+

  @endverbatim
  
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.07, PG.10
      and PG.12 pins
    - Use KEY Push Button connected to PC13 
    - Connect a female/female CAN cable between at least 2 EVAL CAN connectors (CN22)
    - You have to configure the jumpers as follows: 
    
  @verbatim    
       +-------------------------------+
       |   Jumper    |       CAN1      |
       +-------------------------------+
       |   JP10      |       1-2       |
       |   JP11      |      fitted     |
       |   JP16      |      fitted     |
       +-------------------------------+
