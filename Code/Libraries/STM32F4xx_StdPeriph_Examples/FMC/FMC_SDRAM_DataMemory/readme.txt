@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the MT48LC2M3B2B5-7E SDRAM mounted on 
STM324x9I-EVAL RevB as data memory (including heap and stack).
 
The example scenario does not reflect a real application case, its purpose is to
provide only the procedure to follow to use the external SDRAM as data memory.

This example does not use the default library startup file. It uses a modified 
startup file provided with the example. The user has to add the provided startup 
file in the project source list. While startup, the SDRAM memory is configured 
and initialized to be ready to contain data.
  
The user has to configure his preferred toolchain using the provided linker file.
The RAM zone is modified in order to use the external memory as a RAM. 

At this stage, all the used data can be located in the external SDRAM memory.

The user can use the debugger's watch to evaluate "uwTabAddr" and "MSPValue" variables
values which should be equal to "0xC00xxxxx".

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily 
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Update your project settings as follows:
<ul>
 <li> MDK-ARM 
    - in Project->Options for Linker window, uncheck the option "Use Memory Layout
      from Target Dialog". You can then import the scatter file dedicated for this 
      example.

 <li> EWARM 
    - use "stm32f4xx_flash_extsdram.icf" as linker file (under Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates\EWARM)

 <li> TrueSTUDIO 
    - In the project properties window, select 'C/C++ Build'->settings node->'Tool Settings' Tab then 
      the 'C Linker'->General node and use "stm32f4xx_flash_extsdram.ld" as Script File
      (under Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates\TrueSTUDIO).

 <li> SW4STM32
    - In the project properties window, select 'C/C++ Build'->settings then in 'C Linker' file refer to " STM32F439NIHx_FLASH_extsdram.ld".

</ul>

 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
