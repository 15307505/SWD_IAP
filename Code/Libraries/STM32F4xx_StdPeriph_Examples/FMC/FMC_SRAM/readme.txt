@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the FMC to drive the SRAM memory mounted 
on STM32437I_EVAL or STM324x9I_EVAL RevB boards. It uses an associate driver 
developed to interface with the indicated SRAM device.
 
After initializing the device, user can perform read/write operations on it. 
A data buffer is written to the SRAM memory, then read back and checked to verify 
its correctness.
  
To enable the continuous clock feature, the burst access mode must be 
also enabled in the used FMC SRAM bank. The continuous clock will be automatically 
enabled in the FMC SRAM bank 1. 

The user can choose his own configuration by commenting/uncommenting the defines 
for undesired/desired configurations in the memory associate driver's header file, 
for example, to enable the continuous clock feature, uncomment the define for 
the configuration "FMC_CClock_SyncAsync".
  
If the data is read correctly from SRAM, the LED1 is ON, otherwise the LED2 is ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F427xx/437xx and STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32437I-EVAL 
    (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device           
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval_fmc_sram.c
     
   - If "STM32F429_439xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_sram.c
     
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
