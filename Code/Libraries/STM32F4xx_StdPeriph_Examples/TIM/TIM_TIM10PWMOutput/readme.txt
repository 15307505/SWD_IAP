@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
mode.

The TIM10CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), to get TIM10 counter
clock at 21 MHz the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM10CLK / TIM10 counter clock) - 1
   
SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx Devices.

The TIM10 is running at 31.530 KHz: TIM10 Frequency = TIM10 counter clock/(ARR + 1)
                                                    = 21 MHz / 666 = 31.530 KHz

The TIM10 CCR1 register value is equal to 333, so the TIM10 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 30 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 50%:

TIM10 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM10_CCR1/ TIM10_ARR + 1)* 100 = 50%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Connect the following pin to an oscilloscope PF.06: (TIM10_CH1)
    

@par How to use it ?
