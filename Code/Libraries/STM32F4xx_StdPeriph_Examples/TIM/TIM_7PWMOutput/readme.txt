@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 7 PWM signals 
with 4 different duty cycles (50%, 37.5%, 25% and 12.5%).

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx devices.

The objective is to generate 7 PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
The channel 1 and channel 1N duty cycle is set to 50%
The channel 2 and channel 2N duty cycle is set to 37.5%
The channel 3 and channel 3N duty cycle is set to 25%
The channel 4 duty cycle is set to 12.5%
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  (PA.08)
      - TIM1_CH1N (PB.13)
      - TIM1_CH2  (PE.11)
      - TIM1_CH2N (PB.14)
      - TIM1_CH3  (PA.10)
      - TIM1_CH3N (PB.15)
      - TIM1_CH4  (PA.11)
