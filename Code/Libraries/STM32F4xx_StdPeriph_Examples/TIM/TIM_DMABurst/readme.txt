@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update the TIM1 channel1 period and the duty cycle 
using the TIM1 DMA burst feature.

Every update DMA request, the DMA will do 3 transfers of half words into Timer 
registers beginning from ARR register.
On the DMA update request, 0x0FFF will be transferred into ARR, 0x0000 
will be transferred into RCR, 0x0555 will be transferred into CCR1. 

The TIM1CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), to get TIM1 counter
clock at 24 MHz the Prescaler is computed as following:
- Prescaler = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz.

The TIM1 period is 5.8 ms: TIM1 Frequency = TIM1 counter clock/(ARR + 1)
                                          = 24 MHz / 4096 = 5.8 KHz

The TIM1 CCR1 register value is equal to 0x555, so the TIM1 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 5.8 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 33.33%:
TIM1 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR1/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 33.33%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

 @note No need of RCR update, but we should do it because of the ARR and CCR1 
       mapping.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different
      waveforms:  
        - TIM1 CH1 (PA.08)
