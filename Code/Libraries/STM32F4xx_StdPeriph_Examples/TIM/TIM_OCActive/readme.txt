@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different delays.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM3 counter clock at 2 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
- Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx Devices.

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM3_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM3 counter clock  = 500 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 500 ms.

The TIM3 CCR2 register value is equal to 500:
TIM3_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 250 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 250 ms.

The TIM3 CCR3 register value is equal to 250:
TIM3_CH3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 125 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates a signal with a delay equal to 125 ms.

The TIM3 CCR4 register value is equal to 125:
TIM3_CH4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 62.5 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates a signal with a delay equal to 62.5 ms.

The delay corresponds to the time difference between PG.06 and  TIM3_CHx signal
rising edges.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up  
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - Use LED1 connected to PG.06
       - TIM3_CH1 (PC.06)
       - TIM3_CH2 (PC.07)
       - TIM3_CH3 (PC.08)
       - TIM3_CH4 (PC.09)
