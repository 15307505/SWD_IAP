@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the ADC peripheral to convert regular channels 
simultaneously in dual mode using DMA in mode 1.

Regular simultaneous mode is performed on a regular group of channels. 
In Dual ADC mode, ADC1 data are transferred on the first request, ADC2 data are
transferred on the second request and so on.
On each DMA request (one data item is available), a half-word representing an
ADC-converted data item is transferred.
The conversion is triggered by software.

The ADC1 is configured to convert ADC Channel 10 and 11.
The ADC2 is configured to convert ADC Channel 11 and 12.

Note: the sequence length must be the same for both ADCs

In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 =72MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2.
So ADCCLK= 36MHz 

Conversion rate of channel 10 and 12 = 30 cycles => Conversion Time = 36M/30cyc = 1.2Msps.
Conversion rate of channel 11 = 15 cycles => Conversion Time = 36M/15cyc = 2.4Msps.

 @note Refer to "simulation.xls" file to have the diagram simulation of the example.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL, STM32437I-EVAL and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect PC.0, PC.1 and PC.2 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the
      power supply GND to the EVAL board GND)
