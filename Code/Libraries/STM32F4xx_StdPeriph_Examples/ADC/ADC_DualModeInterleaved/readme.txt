@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the ADC peripheral to convert a regular channel 
in Dual interleaved mode using DMA in mode 3 with 5Msps.

DMA mode 3 is used in interleaved mode in 6-bit and 8-bit resolutions.

The Dual interleaved delay is configured 6 ADC clock cycles.

On each DMA request (two data items are available) two bytes representing two 
ADC-converted data items are transferred as a half word.
The data transfer order is similar to that of the DMA mode 2.

A DMA request is generated each time 2 data items are available
1st request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0] 
2nd request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0]

The ADC1 and ADC2 are configured to convert ADC Channel 12, with conversion 
triggered by software.
By this way, ADC channel 12 is converted each 6 cycles.

In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 =72MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2.
Since ADCCLK= 36MHz and Conversion rate = 6 cycle
==> Conversion Time = 36M/6cyc = 6Msps.

 @note Refer to "simulation.xls" file to have the diagram simulation of the example.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL, STM32437I-EVAL and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Connect PC.2 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the power supply 
      GND to the EVAL board GND).
