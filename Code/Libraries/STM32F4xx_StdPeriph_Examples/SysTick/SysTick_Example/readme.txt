@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the SysTick to generate a time base equal to
1 ms. The system clock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F40/41xxx devices and 180 Mhz 
for STM32F42/43xxx devices, the SysTick is clocked by the AHB clock (HCLK).

A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM324x7I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
      
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.07, PG.10
      and PG.12 pins
      
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device 
   - If "STM32F40_41xxx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval.c
           
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
          
   - If "STM32F429_439xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval.c
                 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
