@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use, for debug purpose, the RCC firmware to retrieve 
the current status and frequencies of different on chip clocks. 
You can see the "RCC_ClockFreq" structure content, which hold the frequencies of 
different on chip clocks, using your toolchain debugger.

This example handles also the High Speed External clock (HSE) failure detection:
when the HSE clock disappears (broken or disconnected external Quartz); HSE, PLL
are disabled (but no change on PLL config), HSI selected as system clock source
and an interrupt (NMI) is generated. In the NMI ISR, the HSE, HSE ready interrupts
are enabled, and once HSE clock recovers, the HSERDY interrupt is generated and in
the RCC ISR routine the system clock is reconfigured to its previous state (before
HSE clock failure). You can monitor the HSE clock on MCO1 pin(PA8).

Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

 @note On the STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL/STM324x9I-EVAL RevB boards,  
       to generate the HSE failure you can remove the HSE quartz from the socket.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
