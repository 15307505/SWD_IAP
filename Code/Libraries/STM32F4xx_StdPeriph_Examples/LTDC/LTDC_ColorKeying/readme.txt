@par Example Description

This example shows how to enable and use the color keying functionality.

After LCD initialization, LCD layer 1 and color keying configuration, an image 
is displayed on LCD.
Color keying is enabled/disabled on the image when the tamper button is pressed.
      
 Color Keying :
 --------------
 If the Color Keying is enabled, all pixels are compared to the color key. 
 If they match the programmed RGB value, all channels (ARGB) of that pixel 
 are set to 0.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on and STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32429I-EVAL 
    (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily 
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    board which includes the MB1046 LCD board.
 

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Select STM32F429_439xx workspace and Add the following files in the project 
    source list :
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval.c
     
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
