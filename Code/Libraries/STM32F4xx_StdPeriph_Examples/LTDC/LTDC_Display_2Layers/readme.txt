@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the LTDC peripheral to display two Layers 
at the same time.
The goal of this example is to explain how to blend two layers and how to display 
an image with L8 (8bits per pixels indexed) as pixel format. 
 
After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 and Layer 2 are configured as following :
 - Layer 1 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with direct
   color (RGB565) as pixel format and 320x240 size.
 - Layer 2 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with indirect
   color (L8) as pixel format and 320x240 size.
   To display an image with an indirect color as pixel format a color lookup table (CLUT) 
   is loaded, then every byte from image data (L8_320x240) is considered as 
   a position in color lookup table (CLUT).(see example below)  

The blending is always active and the two layers can be blended following 
the configured blending factors and the constant alpha.
In this example the constant alpha for layer 2 is decreased to see the layer 1
in the intersection zone.

  Example:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |Image data   |  position   CLUT(RGB Value)  |   Alpha  | Output (ARGB value)|
  |-------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------- |

  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFFAE6547         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFFDA14EA         |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
