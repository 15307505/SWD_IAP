                        Example Description \
                        This firmware provides a basic example of how to use the I2C firmware library and\
                        an associate I2C EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the\
                        example is interfacing with M24C64 EEPROM)\
                          \
                        I2C peripheral is configured in Master transmitter during write operation and in\
                        Master receiver during read operation from I2C EEPROM. \
                          \
                        The peripheral used is I2C1 but can be configured by modifying the defines values\
                        in stm324xg_eval.h file. The speed is set to 100kHz and can be configured by \
                        modifying the relative define in stm32_eval_i2c_ee.h file.\
                         \
                        For M24C64 devices all the memory is accessible through the two-bytes \
                        addressing mode and need to define block addresses. In this case, only the physical \
                        address has to be defined (according to the address pins (E0,E1 and E2) connection).\
                        This address is defined in i2c_ee.h (default is 0xA0: E0, E1 and E2 tied to ground).\
                        The EEPROM addresses where the program start the write and the read operations \
                        is defined in the main.c file. \
                         \
                        First, the content of Tx1_Buffer is written to the EEPROM_WriteAddress1 and the\
                        written data are read. The written and the read buffers data are then compared.\
                        Following the read operation, the program waits that the EEPROM reverts to its \
                        Standby state. A second write operation is, then, performed and this time, Tx2_Buffer\
                        is written to EEPROM_WriteAddress2, which represents the address just after the last \
                        written one in the first write. After completion of the second write operation, the \
                        written data are read. The contents of the written and the read buffers are compared.\
                         \
                        All transfers are managed in DMA mode (except when 1-byte read/write operation is\
                        required). Once sEE_ReadBuffer() or sEE_WriteBuffer() function is called, the \
                        use application may perform other tasks in parallel while Read/Write operation is\
                        managed by DMA.\
                          \
                        This example provides the possibility to use the STM324xG-EVAL LCD screen for\
                        messages display (transfer status: Ongoing, PASSED, FAILED).\
                        To enable this option uncomment the define ENABLE_LCD_MSG_DISPLAY in the main.c\
                        file.                                                                              ";
