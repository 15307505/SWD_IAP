@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the RNG peripheral to generate Random 32bit numbers.

For this example, an interactive human interface is developed to allow user to
display 8 (arbitrary value, which can be updated by user) random 32bit numbers
using the eval board LCD and/or USART with PC HyperTerminal, using PRINT_ON_LCD
and PRINT_ON_USART defines in main.h

After startup, user is asked to press KEY button.
The 8 Random 32bit numbers are displayed as soon as the key is pressed.

The USARTx is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F437xx and STM32F439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F41xx 
    Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F437xx Devices) and STM32439I-EVAL RevB (STM32F439xx 
    Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported 
    device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
      
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN8 (USART1) and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP7 is in position 1-2
      
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None
