@par Example Description

This example describes how to use the QSPI firmware library to perform Write operation in memory mapped 
mode and read operation in DMA mode with QSPI FLASH device.

In this example,the QSPI is interfacing with SPANSION S25FL512S FLASH or MICRON MT25QL512AB FLASH memory
and up to user to select the right flash connected on the STM32446E-EVAL/STM32469I-EVAL/STM32412G-DISCO/STM32F413H-DISCO board 
by uncommenting the required line in main.h:
- QSPI_FLASH_SPANSION: QSPI FLASH Spansion
- QSPI_FLASH_MICRON: QSPI FLASH Micron

The QSPI is configured in indirect mode for writing operation, in Autopolling mode to wait 
for the end of each writing command, and Memory Mapped to read from the external flash memory.

This example erase part of the QSPI memory, write data using DMA , read data in Memory Mapped mode
and compare the result in a forever loop.

Once all data buffer are received.A comparison is done and TransferStatus variable gives 
the data transfer status where it is PASSED if transmitted and received data are the same 
otherwise it is FAILED.

@note
The QSPI Clock is configured to reach maximum frequency at 90 MHZ.

@par Hardware and Software environment 
 
  - This example runs on STM32F446xx , STM32F469/479xx , STM32F412xG and STM32F413/423xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32446E-EVAL 
    (STM32F446xx Devices), STM32412G-DISCO (STM32F412xG devices), STM32F413H-DISCO
    (STM32F413_423xx devices) and STM32469I-EVAL(STM32F469xx Devices) evaluation boards
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
