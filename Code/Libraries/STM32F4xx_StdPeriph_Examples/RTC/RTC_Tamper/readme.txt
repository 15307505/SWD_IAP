@par Example Description 

This example shows how to write/read data to/from RTC Backup data registers and 
demonstrates the Tamper detection feature.

One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The associated firmware performs the following:
  
1)It configures the RTC_AF1 pin Tamper to be falling edge, and enables the Tamper 
  interrupt.
     
2)It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the 
  data were correctly written. If yes, LED1 turns ON, otherwise LED3 turns ON.
     
3)When applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13), the RTC backup data registers
  are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated. The corresponding ISR then checks
  whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared or not. If yes LED2 turns ON,
  otherwise LED4 turns ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx and STM32F427xx/437xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the TAMPER push-button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
      
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device 
   - If "STM32F40_41xxx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval.c
      
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
       
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
