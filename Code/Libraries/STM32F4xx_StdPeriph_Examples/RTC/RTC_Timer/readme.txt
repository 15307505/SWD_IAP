@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the RTC peripheral with Alarm sub seconds 
feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms  (1 second/ 8) * 2).
The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
8 interrupt per 1 second).
  
For this example an interactive human interface is developed using STM324xx EVAL’s
LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use Timer with a real progress bar display.

After startup, the timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
the KEY button the progress bar start to be filled for each 2 successive
interrupts (after each 250ms).
After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the progress bar will be full.

User can manipulate the chronometer features using the TAMPER and WAKEUP buttons:
  - Press KEY button to Start the timer.
  - Press WAKEUP button to Reset the timer.
  - Press TAMPER button to Stop the timer.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx and STM32F427xx/437xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Wakeup push-button. 
    - Use the TAMPER push-button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).

       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device 
   - If "STM32F40_41xxx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval_lcd.c
      
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval_lcd.c
       
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
