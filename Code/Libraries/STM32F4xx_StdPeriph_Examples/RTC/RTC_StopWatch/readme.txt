@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the STM32F4xx new RTC's sub-seconds and Tamper 
feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer with 10 
record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers:
 - 10 registers for time (second, minutes and hours)
 - 10 registers for subsecond
  
For this example an interactive human interface is developed using STM324xx EVAL’s 
LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real time display.

After startup, a default chronometer counter format "00:00:00:000" is displayed 
on the LCD, it corresponds to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
User can manipulate the chronometer features using the TAMPER and WAKEUP buttons:
 - Press WAKEUP button to start counter.
 - Press TAMPER button to save trials in the backup registers (max 10 actions).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx and STM32F427xx/437xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Wakeup pash button. 
    - Use the TAMPER push-button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
 
 
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device 
   - If "STM32F40_41xxx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval_lcd.c
      
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval_lcd.c
       
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
