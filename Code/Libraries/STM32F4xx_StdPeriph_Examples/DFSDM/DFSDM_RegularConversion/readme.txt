@par Example Description

This example describes how to use the DFSDM firmware library to perform a regular
conversion in polling mode.

In this example, we will use DFSDM Channel 0 and filter 0 to convert data coming from
DFSDM_DATIN0.

The calculation of the expected value depends on these parameters :
- Filter Oversampling ratio : 100
- Power of sinc order : 1
- Channel Data shift : 2
- Channel offset : 50

The DFSDM_CKOUT(PC2) is configurated to deliver System clok frequency divided 
by an internal DFSDM divider (5 in our example).

The user have to connect a 3.3v signal in DFSDM DataIn0 (PB1).

Once the conversion is done. A comparison is done and ConversionStatus variable gives 
the conversion status where it is PASSED if transmitted and received data are the same 
otherwise it is FAILED.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F412xG devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32F412G-DISCO board RevC and can be 
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - STM32F412G-DISCO RevA Set-up :
     - Connect 3.3V on PB1 (DFSDM_DataIn0)
     - Connect PC2(DFSDM_CKOUT) on oscilloscope.  

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
