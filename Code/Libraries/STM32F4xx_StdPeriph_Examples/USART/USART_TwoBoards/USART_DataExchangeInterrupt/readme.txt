@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use joystick buttons to trigger USART communication 
using interrupts and though using USART firmware library.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them 
BoardA and BoardB) then connect these two boards through UART lines and GND.

 @note The connection between the pins should use a common Ground.

- Software Description

At TAMPER button press, the USART Transmitter Board sends the TxBuffer to 
the USART Receiver Board

Received data correctness is signaled by LED lightening and though as follows:
 - LED2 is ON when the comparison result between source buffer and destination 
   buffer is passed otherwise LED3 is ON.
  
The steps described above can be also initiated and ensured by BoardB. 

In both boards(BoardA or BoardB), the data transfers is managed using USARTx_IRQHandler 
in stm32f4xx_it.c file.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter 
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LED1 each 100ms indicating that the 
firmware is running.
These operations can be repeated infinitely.
