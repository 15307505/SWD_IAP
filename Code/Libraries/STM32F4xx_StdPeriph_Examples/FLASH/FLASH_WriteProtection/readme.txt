@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enable and disable the write protection for FLASH
integrated within STM32F40xx/41xx, STM32F427x/437x and STM32F429x/439x Devices.

By maintaining the Key push-button pressed at Reset, the program will check the 
write protection status of FLASH_WRP_SECTORS (defined in main.c) 
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are write protected, the write protection will be disabled.
    Then LED1 will turn ON, if the protection disable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED3 turns ON.
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are not write protected, the write protection will be enabled.
    Then LED4 will turn ON, if the protection enable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED3 turns ON.

If after reset the Key push-button is not pressed, the program will simply turns ON LED2.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F405xx/407xx, STM32F415xx/417xx, STM32F427xx/437xx and 
    STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427xx/STM32F437xx Devices) and 
    STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and 
    can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)
    
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up  
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.07, PG.10
      and PG.12 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PC13 (EXTI Line13)  
      
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Select the project workspace related to the used device 
   - If "STM32F40_41xxx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL\stm324xg_eval.c
           
   - If "STM32F427_437xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval.c
          
   - If "STM32F429_439xx" is selected as default project Add the following files in the project source list:
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval.c
                 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
