@par Example Description 

This example shows how to to configure the I2S for full duplex communication, 
based on polling mode and through I2S firmware library. 

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them 
BoardA and BoardB) then connect these two boards through I2S lines and GND.
In the firmware example uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file to use
the I2S peripheral as STM32 Master device or as STM32 Slave device.

 @note The connection between the pins should use a short wires and a common Ground.

- Software Description
In this example, the I2S full duplex interface is based on the I2S2 peripheral with 
an extra instance called I2S_ext used only for full duplex communication and can
operate only in Slave Mode.

Both I2Ss are configured as follows:
  - Audio Frequency: 8 KHz
  - Standard: Phillips
  - MCLK Output: disabled
  - CPOL: Low
  - Data Format: 16b

In master board, I2S2 and I2S2_ext are enabled so I2S2 can deliver CK and WS to I2S2_ext.
The I2S2 peripheral is configured as Master Transmitter and I2S2_ext is configured 
as Slave Receiver. Whereas in Slave Board, the I2S2 peripheral is configured as Slave
Receiver ans I2S2_ext is configured as Slave Transmitter. 

- The Slave must be launched before the Master.
- The Master start the communication by sending aTxMasterBuffer buffer through SD pin
  in the same time he receive a buffer through ext_SD pin, which is stored in aRxMasterBuffer. 
- The Slave Start the communication when the clock is already available on CK pin
  the Buffer received from master through SD pin,is stored in RxSlaveBuffer, in the 
  same time the aTxSlaveBuffer buffer is transmitted through ext_SD pin.
    
- In Master Board, after the Communication end, if the received buffer is correct 
  the LED2 and LED4  turns ON.
- In Slave Board, after the Communication end, if the received buffer is correct 
  the LED 3 turns ON.
  
 @note In this example the I2S_MCK signal is not used in the communication, this  
       signal is needed to be provided to external codec audio component.

In both boards, the SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated  
counter inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle LED1 each 100ms indicating that the 
firmware is running.
