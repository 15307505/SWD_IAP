@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure DMA2D peripheral in Memory to Memory 
transfer mode and display the result on LCD.

In this basic example the goal is to explain the different fields of the DMA2D 
structure in the case of Memory_to_Memory transfer mode.

After DMA2D configuration, the data transfer is performed from FLASH memory to
SRAM and then the LCD is configured to display transferred picture on LCD. 
(more details about LCD configuration in LCD examples)

=> Output offset is the number of pixel to be skipped after each transferred line

how to calculate the size of the transferred data ? 
=> selected color mode gives the number of bits per pixel and we have 
(ARGB4444 => 16bits/pixel) the number of pixel per line and the number of line, 
therefore :

data_size = (bits per pixel) X (pixel per line + output offset) X (number of line)
